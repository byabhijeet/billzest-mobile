## 1. High-Level Overview

BillZest Mobile V1 is the essential native companion for retail businesses, designed for speed and offline reliability. It focuses on the core daily operations: creating invoices (billing), managing a unified directory of parties (customers & vendors), tracking the "Credit Book" (udhar/jama), managing product inventory with barcode scanning, and recording business expenses.

The app mirrors the BillZest Web "Credit Management" approach by treating Customers and Vendors as "Parties" and integrates seamless syncing with Supabase.
